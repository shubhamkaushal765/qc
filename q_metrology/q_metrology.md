Enhanced Measurements: Beating the Standard Quantum Limit.”`

- Quantum Metrology is a field concerned with extracting information from a quantum system.
- Quantum Metrology enhances precision using quantum effects (entanglement/squeezing), beyond classical approaches.

## Mach-Zehnder interferometer

In the absence of any phase difference, all photons exit the apparatus as output at detector 1. On the other hand, if $\theta = \pi$ radians, 100% of photons exit at the output detector 2. If the value of $\theta$ is somewhere between $\theta$ and $\pi$ (i.e., if $0 < \theta < \pi$), then a fraction $cos^2\frac{\theta}{2}$ of the photons exit at the output at detector 1 and a fraction $sin^2\frac{\theta}{2}$ at detector 2.

$$
R_z = 
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
e^{-i\theta /2} & 0\\
0 & e^{i\theta /2}
\end{array}\right)
