    "In QCNN, convolutions are operations performed on neighbouring pairs of qubits â€” they are *parameterized unitary rotations*, just like a regular **variational circuit**! These convolutions are followed by pooling layers, which are effected by measuring a subset of the qubits, and using the measurement results to control subsequent operations. The analogue of a fully-connected layer is a *multi-qubit operation* on the remaining qubits before the final measurement. Parameters of all these operations are learned during training.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "One very natural application of QCNNs is classifying quantum states - for example, the original work used them to distinguish between differen*t topological phas*es. QCNNs can also be used to classify images just like their classical counterparts.\n",
