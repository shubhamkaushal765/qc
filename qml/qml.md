## Measurement of inner product of two quantum states

One of the most well known processes for inner product interference is the *swap test*. A method that has been appleid widely to quantum machine learning exercises.

Circuit for swap test:

 By measuring the probability of the first qubit, the square of the inner product ($\langle \phi_A | \phi_B \rangle^2$) can be obtained.

 The swap test has widespread usage in QML, and has been modified to carry out the task of detection and quantifying entanglement in quantum systems.
